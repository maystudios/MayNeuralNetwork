A Minecraft 1.16.5 creative client Mod built for redstone. You can create Plots in Chunk Dimensions up to 32 * 32 (smallest 1 * 1) and every chunk outside this is deactivated, allowing for less lag, more concurrency!

MayRedstone is very different from the traditional redstone Compiler. Because this Client mod allows to disable specific Block Updates or Block Updates in specific areas. (However the Blocks gets updated in background without visibility).

May Redstone make it possible to run programs such as [Graph Rendering, Conway's Game of Life, and Mandelbrot Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg) on CPUs and GPUs in Minecraft. To accomplish these speeds, we created [MayCompiler](docs/Compiler/Redstone/MayCompiler.md), the "Redstone Compiler".
