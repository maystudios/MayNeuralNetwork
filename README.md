## Installation

To build and run the project, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- CUDA toolkit (version 11.1 or higher)
- C++ compiler (supporting C++17 standard)

To build the project, simply run the following commands:

```
sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```


This will generate the executable file cnn in the build directory.
Usage

To use the CNN, you will need to provide a dataset in the format of two files: one for the training set and one for the test set. The data should be in the form of images and labels, with each image and its corresponding label on the same line, separated by a space.

To train the CNN, run the following command:

sh

$ ./cnn train <training_set_file> <test_set_file


This will generate the executable file `cnn` in the `build` directory.

## Usage

To use the CNN, you will need to provide a dataset in the format of two files: one for the training set and one for the test set. The data should be in the form of images and labels, with each image and its corresponding label on the same line, separated by a space.

To train the CNN, run the following command:

$ ./cnn train <training_set_file> <test_set_file>

bash


To test the CNN, run the following command:

$ ./cnn test <test_set_file>

csharp


## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, as well as fully connected layers at the end. The model uses the ReLU activation function and the Adam optimization algorithm.

### Architecture Diagram

The following diagram shows the architecture of the model:

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.2% on the test dataset. Some examples of model predictions are shown below:

### Metrics

| Metric          | Value  |
|-----------------|--------|
| Accuracy        | 99.2%  |
| Loss Function   | 0.0234 |

## Performance

The performance of the CNN can be measured using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score

These metrics can be visualized using graphs and tables, which are included in this repository.
