A convolutional neural network for image recorgnition7

May Redstone make it possible to run programs such as [Graph Rendering, Conway's Game of Life, and Mandelbrot Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDiapbD0Xfg) on CPUs and GPUs in Minecraft. To accomplish these speeds, we created [MayCompiler](docs/Compiler/Redstone/MayCompiler.md), the "Redstone Compiler".
